Are You a Genius? - Quiz Game

This is a text-based quiz game created as part of my group project during my first year of study in the Bachelor of Information Technology program. The game was designed to test knowledge across various subjects, including Chemistry, Physics, and Biology. Inspired by the classic "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" format, the game features randomly selected multiple-choice questions with four possible answers. Players must answer five consecutive questions correctly to achieve the title of "GENIUS!" If they answer incorrectly, the game ends.
